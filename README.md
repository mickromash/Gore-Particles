# Gore-Particles (WIP)
GZDoom mini mod that adds fancy blood particles animations

# Features

* Various blood effects based on GZDoom particles
* Bleeding wounds
* Custom blood color
* Compatibility with other gameplay, monsters or gore mods

Because most of the blood effects are only made of particles (unless blood streams or bleeding wounds are turned on), mod dosen't create any new actors and has pretty much no effect on the performance.
But because all of the blood is visualized with particles, I highly recommend use other mods in case you want blood puddles and spots.
(GZDoom particles aren't working in such a way that when their amount hit the limit, and new particle need to spawn, old ones will wanish, instead, new particles won't spawn until one of the old ones won't disappear)
